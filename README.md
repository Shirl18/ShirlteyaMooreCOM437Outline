Project description
	This project is to identify the specifics behind an app I am to design.  This project will show how the app will keep people connected within an organization and can be personalized and tailored for any organization of any size.  
App functionality
	This app will become a useful tool for any size company, business, or organization.  The first interaction with the app will require a one-time sign-in and will never sign you out unless you want to sign out.  It will alert you when a new announcement or IM comes through and will function offline.  This app is personalizable for companies so there won’t be any announcements, forms, pictures, or contacts attached to the following named buttons. These items will be added using direct uploads from a computer or laptop to the app using the admin button and easy to use and set up.
Problem addressing
•	Communication within an organization 
•	Communication between managers and employees
•	How and what information is released
•	Issues with new hire forms
Platform
	The app will have capabilities for Microsoft Windows, Google's Android OS, Linux Operating System, and Apple macOS/iOS operating systems. The platform will be one of the two: Android Studio or MIT App Inventor.
Front-end/Back-end support
Front-end:
•	A basic user interface that is bright and easy to see and read so that there isn’t any confusion and information is readable and clear.
Back-end: 
•	Program language will be Java. 
•	A cloud storage to allow for a more security for company information. 
•	User authentication for Admin users
Functionality
•	Bulletin style information board
•	The ability to IM
•	Can be accessed offline
Design (wireframes)
A two-dimensional illustration of a page's interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors. Each menu button will have a clean user interface that includes instructions.  The buttons will be large with large text so that they are easily identified.  The announcement section will display current information with an archive or cloud storge for limited historical announcements.  I would like for this section to display the company’s logo some type of picture in the background but that’s not for certain design feature at this moment.
